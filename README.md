## 1- DSing dataset

DSing is an ASR-oriented dataset constructed from the [Smule Sing!300x30x2](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/damp/) dataset (**Sing!**).
This repository provides the scripts to transform **Sing!** to the DSing ASR task. 

## 2- Initial steps

The first step before running any of the scripts is to obtain access to **Sing!** dataset.
For more details, go to [DAMP repository](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/damp/).   

## 3- Transform Sing! to DSing dataset

The scripts to transform the **Sing!** dataset to DSing ASR task dataset are located in the **[DSing Construction](DSing Construction/)** directory.
The process is based on a series of python tools that are summarise in the runme_sing2dsing.sh bash script.

1. Define the variable *version* with the name of the DSing version you want to construct (DSing1, DSing3 or DSing30).
Any other option will rise an error.
2. Set the variable *DSing_dest* with the path where the DSing version will be saved.
3. Set the variable *SmuleSing_path* with the path to your copy of Smule Sing!300x30x2.
4. Run code until step **K** 
5. .....

## 4- Extract DSing dataset using pre-segmented data.

If you want to do some analysis in the segmentation results or to use DSing for different porpoise than ASR.
In directory **[DSing preconstructed](DSing preconstructed)** you can find a small script that allows to recover the 
transcriptions and utterance wav files.
Just need to to set the output directory and the path of your version of **Sing!**
